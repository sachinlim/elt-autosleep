# ETL with AutoSleep data

[AutoSleep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111) is an app available from the Apple App Store, which allows the user to track their sleep using an Apple Watch. The documentation for the app is available on [its website](https://autosleepapp.tantsissa.com/). The specific focus for this project is the usage of the [exported data](https://autosleepapp.tantsissa.com/settings/export) from the app.
